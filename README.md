# Cards Matching Game

The site lives in: https://cards-matching-game-willyan-bertolino.netlify.app/

* This is a classic memory game of matching cards. It allows 1 to 4 players and 12 to 20 different cards which generates 24 to 40 cards 2 by 2.
- Rules:
The first player starts by showing 2 cards. If they are matched, he/she scores and play again. Else, the cards are covered again and the next player plays.

* Score:
The score number depends on the number of times each card has been turned.
1 time -> 10 points
2 times -> 40 points
3 times -> 30 points
4 times -> 20 points
>= 5times -> 10 points
The total score points is the sum of points of each card.

Example: if the first card has been turned 2 times and it's matching 3 times, the score is 40 + 30 = 70.

Enjoy.. :)
