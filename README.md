### Rules: 
The first player starts by showing 2 cards. If they are matched, he/she scores and play again. Else, the cards are covered again and the next player plays.

### Score:
The score number depends on the number of times each card has been turned.
- 1 time -> 10 points
- 2 times -> 40 points
- 3 times -> 30 points
- 4 times -> 20 points
- more than 4 times -> 10 points
The total score points is the sum of points of each card.

Example: if the first card has been turned 2 times and it's matching 3 times, the score is 40 + 30 = 70.

Enjoy.. :)
